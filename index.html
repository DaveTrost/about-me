                    <h2>My Favorite Sports</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm wild about fringe sports. Stuff that you've heard of but never tried. Sports that are for long-haired hippies
                        and skate rats. Well, call me a Gen-Xer. That's just how I like it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are my favorite sports, in chronological order of my introduction to them:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rock Climbing</li>
                            <li>Disc Golf</li>
                            <li>BMX Biking</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started climbing in 2000 at the age of 20 with my college friend Drew. We learned at a local Pittsburgh rock climbing gym
                        that had a bouldering wall and some top-rope routes. We mostly climbed on the bouldering wall. I loved bouldering becuase of the
                        problem solving aspect of it. It felt like solving a puzzle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In early 2003, Drew and I took a 2-month road trip around the western and southern edges of the USA.  
                        Most of our stopping points were outdoor bouldering areas. Some of the highlights included Yosemite, 
                        Joshua Tree, Hueco Tanks, and a sweet sandstone boulder field in Alabama. This trip was one of the
                        highlights of the time I spent rock climbing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another great bouldering destination is at Squamish, British Columbia. Here is a video of my ascent of a favorite
                        climb of mine.

                    <h2>Disc Golf</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2005, I moved to Portland and found that rock climbing, specifically bouldering outdoors, was not in high supply.
                        It was then that my friend Dave G introduced me to the support of Disc Golf. At the time we were playing for fun and
                        we called it "frolf" (a slang term that combines the words frisbee and golf). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After playing for fun for five years I followed my friend into the competitive side of the sport. I began doing drills
                        and practicing different shot shapes. I worked on my distance in the field, and at my strongest I could throw 380 feet. 
                        I had been bitten by "the bug" and I was serious about <span class="strikethrough">frolf</span> the sport of Disc Golf. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the 8 years I have been serious about disc golf, the sport has been growing in leaps and bounds. There are professional
                        athletes whom I follow as they compete in the Disc Golf National Tour and the Disc Golf Pro Tour. The coverage airs on YouTube 
                        for free and I have spent countless hours watching post-production coverage of my favorite players competing in weekend long tournaments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some of my favorite pro players:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eagle McMahon</li>
                            <li>Catrina Allen</li>
                            <li>Paul McBeth</li>
                            <li>Nate Sexton</li>
                            <li>Kevin Jones</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>BMX Biking</h2>
                    <p>
                        I got into BMX biking because of my son. Some friends had recommended a bike park to us that was fun for kids
                        to ride at. It was called "The Lumberyard". I went there with my son who was 4 at the time, and eventually,
                        I would ride with him. It was a fun thing to play around with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="float-left" src="./assets/Lumberyard_Logo.png" alt="Logo of The Lumberyard BMX Park">
                        When my son was 7 he spent several months taking weekly classes at the lumberyard. During class hours, 
                        they offered a reduced rate for parents, and I took advantage of this. I met other parents who rode; we started
                        riding together; we rode more and more. Some tips we got along the way from other riders and some of the coaches 
                        went a long way and we slowly improved our skills
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I am almost good enough to keep up with my son!
